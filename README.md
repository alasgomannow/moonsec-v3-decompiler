A moonsec-v3 decompiler made by scripters for scripters.

This server: https://discord.gg/6NXHSpv36M has a completely free moonsec-v3 decompiler, all you need to do is type ".dec" and upload the file you want to decompile.

Avoid tr4ash, his products are paid, and may not be real.

Avoid 08v3, and getglobal (formerly known as !yo) they are ultra skidder, the most ultra skid and gold digger seen on the planet, 08v3 and getglobal are skids using a leaked moonsec-v3 decompiler, if you decide to pay them, expect to get scammed.

08v3, !yo (getglobal), lishbon (bat) are licensing a moonsec deobfuscator for their own profits which they did not make.

I have copyrights over the project which i made and any license they make over it are invalid and does not hold up to the law. They are licensing it for large sums of money while the one inside the server is free, authentic and made by me.
